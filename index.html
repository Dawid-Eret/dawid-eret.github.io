					<p>	Programming focused YouTube channel where I post tutorials and courses for different languages, such as: Java, Python, 
						and others <a target="_blank" class="projectLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/@definitelynoah">(channel link)</a>.</p>
					<p> It started as a social media assignment back in college, but then turned into a hobby which I also use as a learning opportunity.</p>
					<p> I like to think that you only really understand a topic, if you can explain it in simple terms.</p>

					<p> Android application I'm working on made in Java. It's an application for notes, tasks, and deadlines.
						 What makes it different than most other apps is the option to share your notes etc. with other people.</p>
					<p> To add a person to your friends list you need their email, and they need to accept it.</p>
					<p>You will also be able to share to groups rather than individuals.</p>

					<div class="projectCardDate"><p class="date">2023 Hackathon (24 hours)</p><p class="tag python">Python</p></div>
					<p> Simple game written in python, made as a group project during HackNotts84. The hackathon allowed pretty much any project to be made in 24 hours 
						<a target="_blank" class="projectLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyPHw4a3_8c">(gameplay video)</a>.</p>
					<p> Most of the game code was written by me. One of the team members made a 
						<a target="_blank" class="projectLink" href="http://typochamp.com/">website</a> 
						where the project files can be downloaded.</p>
					<p>  The only requirement is PyGame. It's a scored typing game with falling words.</p>
